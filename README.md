# Elitium's Storage System

Literal library of random code that I would like to keep neatly for future reference. Includes specific algorithm types that help me with competition coding thus far.

## Usage

First step is navigating through the first layer of folders, which should cover a general application or area of code that I am working on. Each folder is then split into subgroups for easy access of specific categories (as i said, literally a library)

```bash
RandomAlgos/Leetcode/TwoPointers
RandomAlgos/Leetcode/Backtracking
RandomAlgos/Leetcode/prefixSum
RandomAlgos/SelfProblems
```
